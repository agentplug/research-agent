**Customer Segments Affected**: Academic researchers, Graduate students, Corporate researchers, Policy analysts, Journalists, Consultants

## Problem Statement

**Core Problem**: Researchers across all domains struggle with information overload, fragmented research workflows, and the time-consuming process of synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources. Current research tools are either too generic (basic search engines) or too specialized (domain-specific databases), creating gaps in comprehensive research capabilities.

**Dual-Mode Requirement**: The research agent must function both as a standalone research tool AND as a collaborative team member in complex multi-agent workflows, enabling both independent research and seamless integration into larger research pipelines.

**Specific Pain Points**:
- **Information Fragmentation**: Research data scattered across multiple platforms, databases, and formats
- **Time-Intensive Synthesis**: Manual process of connecting insights from different sources takes weeks
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Difficulty identifying relevant connections between seemingly unrelated research areas
- **Citation Management**: Complex process of tracking and formatting citations across different standards
- **Research Validation**: Lack of systematic approach to verify information quality and source reliability
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Difficulty sharing research findings and collaborating across teams
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: No standardized way for research agents to collaborate with other specialized agents

## Pain Point Analysis

### 1. Information Overload Crisis
**Current State**: Researchers spend 60-80% of their time searching and organizing information rather than analyzing it
**Impact**:
- Reduced time for actual analysis and insight generation
- Increased cognitive load leading to decision fatigue
- Higher risk of missing critical information
- Delayed project timelines

**Customer Quote**: *"I spend more time managing my research files than actually thinking about the problem I'm trying to solve"* - PhD Student, Computer Science

- **Direct Users**: Uses standard/deep modes for comprehensive research via specific methods or `solve()` method
- **Seamless Transition**: Works perfectly in both individual and team environments

The key to success lies in focusing on the complete research journey rather than individual tools, creating a seamless experience that makes researchers more productive, confident, and effective in their work, whether working alone or as part of a sophisticated multi-agent team. The usage-based mode design ensures optimal performance for both individual researchers and collaborative team workflows.
